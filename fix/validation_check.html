<h3>Website #1</h3>
<p>The first website I chose was http://www.skino.it/ . This website is a portfolio for a web designer and front end developer.</p>
<p>It contained 1 error, which was simply the use of an obsolete tag that can be replaced using any level of the header elements.</p>

<h3>Website #2</h3>
<p>The second website I chose was http://www.rankya.com.au/. It is a website for a search engine optimization business. This website passed the validation check with no errors.</p>

<h3>Website #3</h3>
<p>The third website I chose was http://pwlpartnership.com/. This website is for a landscape architectural firm. When validated, this website returned 4 errors, three of which can be easily fixed by adding alt tags to their images.  </p>

<h3>Website #4</h3>
<p>The final website I chose was http://www.leadmotion.mobi/. This is a website for a business to generate leads for multiple financial revenues. This website returned 2 errors, 1 of which can be fixed by grouping the header elements with a div class.</p>
